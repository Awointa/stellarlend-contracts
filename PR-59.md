Title: feat: Add flash loan support with modular callback flow (#59)

## Summary
Modularizes flash loan functionality into a dedicated module and validates flow with events and configurable fees.

## Changes
- New module `flash_loan.rs` with `FlashLoan::execute`
- Lib entrypoint `flash_loan(...)` now delegates to the module
- Uses `on_flash_loan(asset, amount, fee, initiator)` callback and emits start/complete events

## Validation
- `cargo build && cargo test` pass

## Notes
- Repayment accounting and transfer settlement are intentionally left to integrations; this module provides the safe execution flow and hooks.
