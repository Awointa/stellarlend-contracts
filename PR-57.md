Title: feat: Add support for multiple assets with cross-collateralization (#57)

## Summary
Builds on cross-asset support with portfolio-aware elements: pairwise asset correlations and a portfolio risk ratio view.

## Changes
- Correlation registry: `set_asset_correlation(a, b, corr_bps)`
- Portfolio view: `get_portfolio_risk_ratio(user)` (placeholder penalty model)
- Keeps existing cross-asset functions intact

## Validation
- `cargo build && cargo test` pass

## Notes
- Correlation use is a placeholder; can be expanded to full covariance-based portfolio VAR in future iterations.
