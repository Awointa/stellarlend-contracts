Title: feat: Optimize and improve the interest rate calculation model (#55)

## Summary
Improves the interest rate model by introducing rate smoothing and extensible parameters for future dynamic adjustments, while keeping current API behavior and defaults intact.

## Changes
- Added new `InterestRateConfig` fields:
  - `smoothing_bps` and `util_sensitivity_bps`
- Added `smoothed_borrow_rate` to `InterestRateState`
- Updated `update_state` to compute a smoothed borrow rate and derive supply rate from it
- Preserves existing default parameters used by current tests

## Validation
- `cargo build && cargo test` pass

## Notes
- Ready for plugging in advanced curves and volatility-based adjustments in follow-ups.
