Title: feat: Add governance mechanisms for protocol parameter updates (#58)

## Summary
Introduces DAO-style governance scaffolding for decentralized parameter management, including proposals, voting, quorum, and timelock.

## Changes
- New module `governance.rs` with:
  - `Proposal`, `VoteReceipt` types
  - Storage for proposals and vote receipts
  - Quorum (bps) and timelock configuration
- Contract entrypoints to propose, vote, queue (post-vote), and execute (post-timelock)

## Validation
- `cargo build && cargo test` pass

## Notes
- Execution is a no-op placeholder; follow-ups can wire to parameter updates gated by governance outcomes.
