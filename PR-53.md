Title: feat: Replace mock oracle with real price oracle integration (#53)

## Summary
Implements a real oracle integration with support for multiple sources, median aggregation, and health checks with fallback to internal prices.

## Changes
- New module `oracle.rs` with:
  - `OracleSource` records (address, weight, last_heartbeat)
  - Storage and admin TTL controls
  - Multi-source fetch and median aggregation
- lib integration:
  - `get_asset_price` now prefers aggregated oracle, falls back to internal price map
  - Admin entrypoints to set/remove sources and configure heartbeat TTL

## Health & Fallbacks
- Heartbeat TTL filters stale sources
- Median aggregation improves robustness
- Fallback to internal price map when no healthy oracle sources

## Validation
- `cargo build && cargo test` pass

## Notes
- Oracle source contracts expected to expose `get_price(asset: Address) -> i128` returning 1e8-scaled price.
