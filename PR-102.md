Title: feat: Implement Advanced Performance Optimization (#102)

## Summary
Adds non-breaking performance scaffolding to monitor and optimize protocol operations with counters and a simple on-chain cache.

## Changes
- Performance counters map (`PerfStorage::inc_counter/get_counter`).
- Lightweight cache map (`PerfStorage::cache_set/cache_get`).
- Events: `PerfMetric(metric, value)` and `CacheUpdated(key, op)`.
- All additions are optional and do not alter core flows.

## Validation
- `cargo build && cargo test` pass.

## Notes
- Parallelism is constrained on-chain; this focuses on instrumentation, cache hints, and efficient storage access patterns.
