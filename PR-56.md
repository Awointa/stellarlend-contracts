Title: feat: Enhance liquidation mechanism with advanced features (#56)

## Summary
Extends liquidation with scaffolding for partial liquidations via auctions, including events and basic queueing mechanics.

## Changes
- New types and storage:
  - `LiquidationAuction` and auction book storage
- Events:
  - `AuctionStarted`, `AuctionBidPlaced`, `AuctionSettled`
- Functions:
  - `start_liquidation_auction`, `place_liquidation_bid`, `settle_liquidation_auction`
- Preserves existing direct `liquidate` path and close factor behavior.

## Validation
- `cargo build && cargo test` pass

## Notes
- Token movement/settlement and pricing tie-ins are placeholders to be completed with AMM and oracle hooks.
