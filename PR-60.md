Title: feat: Enhance risk management with advanced features (#60)

## Summary
Builds on risk management with simple monitoring hooks and alerts, complementing dynamic collateral factors and risk scoring.

## Changes
- Event `RiskAlert(user, score)` and emission when score crosses threshold
- Reuses existing dynamic CF and risk scoring scaffolding
- Leaves room for automated adjustments and alerting integrations

## Validation
- `cargo build && cargo test` pass

## Notes
- Thresholds/logic are placeholders; can be parameterized by governance in future iterations.
