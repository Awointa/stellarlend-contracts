# Add Cross-Chain Bridge Integration #91

Implement cross-chain bridge integration to enable lending and borrowing across different blockchain networks, expanding the protocol's reach and liquidity.

Requirements:
- Design cross-chain bridge interfaces for popular networks
- Implement asset bridging functionality
- Add cross-chain position management
- Create bridge fee structures and incentives
- Ensure proper validation for cross-chain operations

Acceptance Criteria:
- Users can bridge assets from other networks
- Cross-chain positions are properly tracked and managed
- Bridge fees are reasonable and transparent
- All cross-chain operations are properly validated
- Bridge integration is secure and auditable
- Comprehensive test coverage for cross-chain scenarios

Technical Considerations:
- Design efficient interfaces for multiple bridge protocols
- Ensure proper validation for cross-chain transactions
- Consider gas costs for complex bridge operations
- Implement proper event logging for bridge activities
