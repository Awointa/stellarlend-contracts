Title: feat: Add actual token transfer functionality for deposits and withdrawals (#54)

## Summary
Integrates Soroban Token client to perform real token transfers for deposits and withdrawals with admin controls for safe rollout.

## Changes
- Added admin flags and storage:
  - `set_enforce_transfers(flag)` to enable/disable transfers
  - `set_base_token(token: Address)` to set the primary token for single-asset deposit/withdraw
- On deposit: optional `transfer_from(user -> contract)`
- On withdraw: optional `transfer(contract -> user)`
- Preserves all existing logic; disabled by default to avoid breaking environments without tokens.

## Validation
- `cargo build && cargo test` pass

## Notes
- Requires users to approve the contract to spend tokens via standard token approval before deposits when enforcement is enabled.
